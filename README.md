I'm Daniel, and this is my text explaining my process for completing the frontend developer test for ThrillX.

First of all, for better reference, it took me around 8-9 hours in total to complete this test. Due to work commitments, I only had one day available to do the test, so honestly, as feedback for myself, I think with a little more time I could have done a better job, especially with the carousel.

But moving on, for this front, I used Bootstrap with Swiper.js for the vertical carousel area. I coded all the sections from scratch, including CSS styles, JavaScript, and HTML. I used my own server to host images and to upload the front to a live version.

Regarding the development process, the first thing I did was watch the entire video a couple of times and read the email and PDF instructions until I had a clear understanding of the full scope of the project. Once I had a clear big picture of the process and what was required for each section, the first thing I did was investigate the reference page link for the carousel section. There, with an extension called Wappalyzer, I identified that for that part they used a JavaScript library called Swiper.js (which I hadn't used), which would help me later develop my approach to that section.

Seeing that the front looked like an already built site, I decided to look for a live version of that site to have a better development reference, which I found. I saw that the site was a WordPress site using Elementor (and I couldn't use any page builder), so it was only useful as a reference. But it still helped me see certain animations and effects that I added to my test, as well as see that it also used Swiper.js for the carousel part, so just a brief investigation was enough to determine that Swiper.js was the best option for that section.

Thus, to facilitate code analysis and a cleaner approach, I decided to take a section-by-section development approach. I developed each element of the Figma one by one (desktop and mobile version), starting with the header with a mega menu in both versions. When I finished, I developed section 2 in both versions as well, and so on, I developed section by section, updating the CSS and JavaScript files for animations, paying attention to the details in Figma.

I used Visual Studio with a live preview extension for coding, and in the end, I committed to my git repository and uploaded the live frontend to a private server I have.

Thank you very much for paying attention to my test and this video, I hope you like it, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Regards, Daniel!
